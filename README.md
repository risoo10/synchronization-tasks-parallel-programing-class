# synchronization-tasks-parallel-programing-class

This is a collection of simple synchronization tasks from real world scenarios.  Implemented in C using P_THREADs.

## Test and practice
This was created as I was testing and learning for the test in Parallel Programming class.
I was faced with real world scenario of synchronization and my goal was to implement it in code.

## Implementaion
We had to implement this task in C using P_THREAD multithreading tools. We were allowed to use only MUTEXes and CONDITIONs.
